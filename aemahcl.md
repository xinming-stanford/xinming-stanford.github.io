## AEAm∙HCl
##### Xinming Tong, Jan-16 2018

### Materials
1. N-Boc-1,2-diaminoethane (MW 160.21, d. 1.012; N-Boc-ethylenediamine, tert-Butyl N-(2-aminoethyl)carbamate; Oakwood products, $73.5/100g)
2. Acryloyl chloride (MW 90.51, d. 1.114; Sigma, A24109, $114/100g)
3. Triethylamine (TEA, MW 101.19, d. 0.7255)

### Synthesis
#### Step 1
1. Dissolve 10 g N-Boc-ethylenediamine in 100 mL THF.
2. Cool solution with ice bath.
3. Add 9 mL TEA to the solution.
4. Dissolve 5.5 mL acryloyl chlodride in 30 mL THF and then drop into the solution above.
    * TEA∙HCl salt will form as precipitate. 
5. Stir overnight.
6. Filter to remove the insoluble salt. 
7. Evaporate solvent and vacuum dry. 
    * DO NOT heat the solution over 40°C, or may lead to undesirable polymerization. 

**[Note]**: Use larger volume and low temperature may help avoid self-polymerization of the acrylamide groups.

#### Step 2
1. Cooling with ice bath, add 80 mL HCl in dioxane (4M) to the solid crude product above.
    * Can replace dioxane solution with HCl in THF. (THF has lower b.p. than dioxane) 
2. Stir for 6 hrs. (keep ice bath cooling)
3. Filter to collect the solid and wash with diethyl ether.
4. Vacuum dry.

**[Note]**: If the solid is very sticky or oil like, it's suggesting quite amount of the monomers are polymerized. **Consider systhesizing another batch**.
